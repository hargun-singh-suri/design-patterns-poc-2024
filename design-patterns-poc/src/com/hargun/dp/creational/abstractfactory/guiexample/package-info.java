/**
 * Creation of GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkits.
 * 
 * Consider a software application that needs to support different operating
 * systems with distinct functionalities. The application must be able to create
 * UI components, such as buttons and windows, that adhere to the specific
 * visual styles and behaviors of each operating system (e.g., Windows and
 * macOS). The challenge is to design a system that allows the creation of UI
 * components for different operating systems without modifying the existing
 * codebase.
 * 
 * Approach -
 * 
 * Identify Abstract Products and Factories:
 * 
 * Define abstract product interfaces (e.g., Button and Window) that represent
 * the UI components. Declare an abstract factory interface (e.g., GUIFactory)
 * with methods for creating these abstract products.
 * 
 * Implement Concrete Products and Factories:
 * 
 * Create concrete product classes (e.g., WindowsButton, WindowsWindow,
 * MacOSButton, MacOSWindow) that implement the abstract product interfaces for
 * each operating system. Implement concrete factory classes (e.g.,
 * WindowsFactory and MacOSFactory) that implement the abstract factory
 * interface and produce the corresponding concrete products.
 * 
 * Client Code:
 * 
 * In the client code (e.g., Application), instantiate the appropriate concrete
 * factory based on the target operating system. Use the factory methods to
 * create UI components without knowing the specific implementations.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * =======================================================================
 * 
 * 
 * Abstract Product:It's like a blueprint or a common set of features that
 * different products should have. Imagine you're ordering a car. The abstract
 * product is what you expect from any car: wheels, seats, engine, etc. It
 * doesn't specify the exact details but gives a general idea.
 * 
 * Abstract Factory: This is like a factory template. Going back to the car
 * example, an abstract factory would be a type of factory that knows how to
 * create cars, but it doesn't specify the exact model or features. It's a
 * general plan for creating products (cars, in this case) with their abstract
 * features.
 * 
 * in the context of design patterns:
 * 
 * Abstract Product: The common features/interface that different concrete
 * products should implement.
 * 
 * Abstract Factory: The interface or abstract class that declares the factory
 * methods for creating abstract products. Concrete factories, implementing this
 * interface, will produce concrete products while adhering to the general plan.
